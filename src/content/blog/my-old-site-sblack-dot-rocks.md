# my old site, sblack.rocks is being retired
My old static site, was really fun to build (and one of the last things I did in Typescript 
- which is a FANTASTIC language) but is way more complicated than managing a simple static site like 
this one, which I can write in Markdown!  

I'm going to keep it on the web, projects like that have nostaligic value. Like looking 
at old family photos it brings back warm memories and lets me know how much I've learned 
since then!

You can find it at [https://sblack4.github.io/sblack.rocks.old/](https://sblack4.github.io/sblack.rocks.old/) 

Happy coding!
