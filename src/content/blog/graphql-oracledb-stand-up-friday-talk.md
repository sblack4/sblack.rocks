## My first developer talk in the books!

You can see the presentation yourself at, 

[unofficialoraclecloudhub.github.io/oracledb-graphql-demo/](https://unofficialoraclecloudhub.github.io/oracledb-graphql-demo/)

This site (hosted from out unofficial cloud-hub GitHub repository) has all the materials I presented in my talk.
The GitHub repo that has the code for the site also has everything you need to run the modified GraphsiQL app on 
a real Oracle Database yourself!

### Building it
Not a trivial task. 

I was hoping to have the demo done three weeks before hand (before Q4 really picked up) but a last-minute trip to San Fransisco to 
record at Oracle Studios and two HUGE projects for my Masters degree derailed all plans. In the end my goal was to finish it over the weekend. 
All in all I finished *most* of this in a week (and spent most of that time fiddling with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)). 
Gatsby is a fine and good static site generator but I wouldn't trade it for Hugo any day. I'll have to do comparison 
between [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),  [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) once I get a chance to give Docusaurus a try.

### Presenting it 

This was the fun part. 

I don't know who ended up showing up (there were just under 50 people there for the live event) but Thank You! 
I enjoy talking about cool stuff I'm playing with. I do so much reading (blogs, documentation, workshops) that sometimes I just
want make some of my own!
