# Check out Oracle Stream Analytics, Built on Spark 

As with all cool software, you can check it out on github. check out my samples here 

[https://github.com/sblack4/dockerfiles/tree/master/oracle-stream-analytics](ihttps://github.com/sblack4/dockerfiles/tree/master/oracle-stream-analytics)

I'm going to trust you have some familiarity with 
shell 
and 
docker
(or access to 
[containers in the cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/container-classic)
If so, this should be a cinch! 

## Running 

I've got windows 10 to this is me using 
[cmder](http://cmder.net/)
and 
[windows-subshell-for-linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
although lately I've been really digging 
[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). 

Here's me installing 
[docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 on the
[windows-subshell-for-linux]() 
what feels a lot like a super lightweight docker container mapped to your filesystem 

```sh
C:\Users\gense
Î» bash
gense@LAPTOP-IK26DBRF:/mnt/c/Users/gense$ sudo apt-get install docker

and now just clone

locally!
