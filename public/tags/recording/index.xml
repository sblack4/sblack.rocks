      <description>Recording in Oracle Studios My team and I had a lot of fun recording demos at Oracle Studios in Redwood Shores, CA!
Check out the green room where @AZaman001 was recording her IOT demo. Not only did the recording staff let us re-record, so we got everything just right, but we got fed too!
The weather was a little chilly - but I do love exploring new places! There were plenty of interesting sights</description>
