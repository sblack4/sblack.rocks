### find me notes on [blog.sblack.rocks](http://blog.sblack.rocks/)

I've started using evernote and with it discovered [Postach.io](https://postach.io/), which is freak'in cool! Now I can publish my evernote notes here [blog.sblack.rocks/](http://blog.sblack.rocks/) without doing anything :) 


I still like having a static site on github though, I don't really need anything more. Having control over all the files and (some) control of the content serving is great so I don't plan on deleting this one... although [wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) has caught my eye as a side project for my (non-existent) free-time ;)
