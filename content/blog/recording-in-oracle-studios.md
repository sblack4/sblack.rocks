# Recording in Oracle Studios

My team and I had a lot of fun recording demos at Oracle Studios in Redwood Shores, CA! 

Check out the green room where @AZaman001 was recording her IOT demo. 
Not only did the recording staff let us re-record, so we got everything just right, but we got fed too!

The weather was a little chilly - but I do love exploring new places! There were plenty of interesting sights

Including this sign and one with duke, the java mascont, on a stop-sign. 

There was all kinds of editing equipment, cameras, and a server room!

## Streaming Data at Avocado inc

Our Demo was on Avocado inc (a ficticious company) with a sick logo by yours truly

that was having trouble integrating their data to make it actionable. They leverage 
[Oracle Event Hub](), 
[Oracle Big Data Cloud](), 
and [Oracle Analytics Cloud]()
